# integrated-science-report

TeX template for Integrated Science students at Warwick prepared by Andrew Blanks and Stephen Royle.

The idea is to write a report, based on an eLife manuscript

To use this template:

1. delete any lines that contain `\lipsum` or other instructions
2. type your report!
3. upload your own refs.bib file (the output from Zotero or other reference manager)
4. upload your figures (png, jpeg or pdf is fine, avoid large tiff files)

This template can be used in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) or in a standalaone TeX editor such as `texstudio`.
